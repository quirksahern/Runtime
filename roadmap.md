# Project Road Map

The current version of this project was created for idea demonstration as part of the SSI Collaborations Workshop 2024 Hack Day.
There are a number of ways that this project could be developed.

## Stronger connection to the literature - pedagogical connection
Integrate links to literature to extend concepts introduced during game play.
This could either be through the facilitation documentation or as open educational reosurces that could be shared with students.

## Multiplayer options
To increase impact of the learning experience, the game would benefit from multiplayer functionality.
- Facilitator
- Researcher
- Gatherers

Researcher and Gatherer roles to be automatically allocated upon joining game.
Separate user interfaces to be developed for each user. The Facilitator functionality will need to be developed to align with the game logic.

## Optional Pathways
These would demonstrate different types of compute job, and/or different forms of energy (dis)proportionality.
E.g. the materials need may be the seem., but the human, water and energy requirements may vary based on the type of job.

## Possible development options (e.g. VR/AR, physical card based)
For an offline experience, a card based game could be developed from existing resources.
VR/AR could be developed to create a more immersive experience, Gatherers would be in a virtual/augmented environment representing a real-world landscape such as an open cast mine to retrieve materials etc.

## Wearables integration
A further development option could be to incorporate wearables. Messages could be sent to devices to prompt for tasks, data may also be read for evidence of completing tasks.
