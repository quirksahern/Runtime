# Project Road Map

The current version of this project was created for idea demonstration as part of the SSI Collaborations Workshop 2024 Hack Day.
There are a number of ways that this project could be developed.

## Stronger connection to the literature - pedagogical connection
Integrate links to literature to extend concepts introduced during game play.
This could either be through the facilitation documentation or as open educational reosurces that could be shared with students.

## Optional Pathways
These would demonstrate different types of compute job, and/or different forms of energy (dis)proportionality.
E.g. the materials need may be the seem., but the human, water and energy requirements may vary based on the type of job.

## Multiplayer options
